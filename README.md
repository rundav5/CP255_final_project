## Introduction

**My research question** is if mobility restrictions worked to contain COVID-19 infection and deaths in Colombia. To answer the question, I will analyze and visualize cases and deaths over time and compare it to mobility restriction measures or proxys. The following are the **datasets** used in this project: 
1. [Confirmed COVID-19 cases reported by Colombian National Government](https://www.ins.gov.co/Noticias/Paginas/coronavirus-casos.aspx)
2. [The Oxford Stringency Index (OSI)](https://www.bsg.ox.ac.uk/research/research-projects/covid-19-government-response-tracker)
3. [COVID-19 Google Mobility Reports](https://www.google.com/covid19/mobility/)
4. ~~[COVID-19 Apple Mobility Trends Report](https://covid19.apple.com/mobility)~~ (As of April 14, 2022, Apple is no longer providing COVID-19 mobility trend reports)

Several online portals, such as [Our World in Data](https://ourworldindata.org/coronavirus), [Coronavirus tracker](https://gorkang.shinyapps.io/2020-corona/), and [Financial Times](https://www.ft.com/content/a2901ce8-5eb7-4633-b89c-cbdf5b386938), developed and published COVID-19 data visualizations and comparisons at a global and country scale. Nevertheless, those analyses do not differenciate between dates related to each case. For example, there is a difference between analyzing the number of daily cases by date of report than by date of diagnosis. The COVID-19 curves comparisons have been usually made based on the date of report, that can have "delay" of two (2) or three (3) weeks from the date of infection. This represents a crucial limitation to evaluate the real effect of policy measures, such as mobility restrictions, to contain the spread of the virus.
